# Market_Basket_Analysis
This project performs market basket analysis for a sales dataset from an international coffee house chain. The dataset was constructed by collecting receipts over a period of two weeks from two locations, and then tabulating the data in the dataset. The dataset has the following columns:
1) time Stamp: Date and time when the purchase was made
2) Day of week
3) Item name
4) Item price
5) Total price payed
6) Total tax
7) Order in-store or to-go
